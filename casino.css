/*
    This is the CSS stylesheet of your game User Interface.

    Styles defined on this file will be applied to the HTML elements you define
    in your HTML template (casino_casino.tpl), and to HTML elements you create
    dynamically (in casino.js).

    Usually, you are using CSS to:

    1°) define the overall layout of your game
        (ex: place the board on the top left, place player's hand beside, place
         the deck on the right, ...).

    2°) create your CSS-sprites:
        All images of your games should be gathered into a small number of image
        files. Then, using background-image and background-position CSS
        properties, you create HTML blocks that can display these images
        correctly (see example below).

    3°) ... anything else:
        It is really easy to add and remove CSS classes dynamically from your
        Javascript with dojo.addClass and dojo.removeClass. It is also easy to
        check if an element has a class (dojo.hasClass) or to get all elements
        with a specific class (dojo.query). This is why, very often, using CSS
        classes for the logic of your user interface allow you to do complex
        thing easily.


     Note: on the production platform, this file will be compressed and comments
     will be removed. Consequently, don't hesitate to put as many comments as
     necessary.
